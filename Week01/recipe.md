![step1](../Week01/Process/1.jpeg)  

<strong> 1. Mix the marinade</strong>
- In a large bowl combine soy sauce, rice wine, and egg whites.

![step2](../Week01/Process/2.jpeg)  

<strong>2. Cut the chicken into small pieces</strong>
- Each piece should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width and length. 
- It should be thawed before preparing. But in fact, frozen chicken is better to cut.

![step3](../Week01/Process/3.jpeg)  

<strong>3. Let the chicken marinate in the marinade</strong>
- Marinate the chicken pieces in a bowl and toss with a fork or spoon to evenly coat the chicken pieces with the marinade. 
- Let the chicken marinate for 10-30 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap

<strong>4. Cut the chicken into small pieces</strong>
- Each piece should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width and length. It should be thawed before preparing. 
- But in fact, frozen chicken is better to cut.

![step5](../Week01/Process/5.jpeg)  

<strong>5. “Paint” the chicken</strong>
- Let the chicken hang over the bowl for a few seconds before taking out to allow excess flour to drip off.
- When done, give it a shake to remove excess flour.

![step6](../Week01/Process/6.jpeg)  

<strong>1. Heat the garlic</strong>
- Heat 1 tablespoon (15 mL) oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, sauté minced garlic for 1 minute or until fragrant or browned..
- Stir the garlic constantly to prevent burning.
- Sprinkle a few drops of water into the pan to test the oil temperature. If the water sizzles when it comes into contact with the oil, the oil is hot enough.
- Use vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil.

![step7](../Week01/Process/7.jpeg)  

<strong>2. Mix other ingredients</strong>
- In a medium bowl combine chicken stock, tomato paste, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, chili sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and cornstarch.
- Make sure both the cornstarch and sugar are completely dissolved.
- If you don't have rice vinegar, you can use distilled white vinegar instead.
- If you don't have chicken stock, use broth or water.
- If you can't find chili paste, you can use 2 teaspoons (10 mL) chili.

![step8](../Week01/Process/8.jpeg)  

<strong>3. Add liquid to the pot</strong>
- Slowly pour in the seasoned chicken broth and garlic. 
- Stir constantly until the sauce thickens.
- The soy sauce should be thick and shiny.
- After thickening, reduce heat and cover pot to maintain temperature.

![step9](../Week01/Process/9.jpeg)  

<strong>1. Heat frying oil</strong>  
- Heat 3 cups (750 ml) of oil for frying in a large pot.
- Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. 
- It can be used when it reaches temperatures between 350 and 360 degrees Fahrenheit (177 to 182 degrees Celsius).
- Use vegetable oil, canola oil, peanut oil, or grapeseed oil.

![step10](../Week01/Process/10.jpeg)  

<strong>2. Fried the chicken</strong>
- In batches of 2-4, fry the chicken until golden and crispy. 
- The inside of the chicken is also fried, and each piece needs to be fried for about 4 to 5 minutes.
- Before frying a batch of chicken, throw in a piece of chicken to test the oil temperature, then fry for 4 minutes. 
- If appropriate, add the rest of the chicken to the pot.

![step11](../Week01/Process/11.jpeg)  

<strong>3. Fried the chicken</strong>  
- As each piece of chicken is cooked through, remove it with a slotted spoon and drain on a clean paper towel.
- Use a slotted spoon to tap the edges or sides of the pan or deep fryer lightly as you move the chicken to keep the oil from splattering.

![step12](../Week01/Process/12.jpeg)  

<strong>1. Heat the oil again over medium-high heat</strong>
- If your pan is heavy, pour in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of fresh oil and heat over medium-high heat.
- A deep fryer can also be used.
- Use this recipe for other types of oils as well.

![step13](../Week01/Process/13.jpeg)  

<strong>2. Stir fry the peppers</strong>
- Add dried red chilies and stir-fry in oil. It only takes 20 to 30 seconds.
- If preferred, sauté the peppers before adding for a more even distribution.

![step14](../Week01/Process/14.jpeg)  

<strong>3. Transfer the sauce to the pan</strong>
- Pour the sauce into the pot and cook for 1 minute, stirring, to combine with the peppers.
- Since the sauce is thick and stays warm, this step doesn't take too long. 
- Just heat until a few bubbles form.

![step15](../Week01/Process/15.jpeg)  

<strong>4. Add Chicken</strong>
- Transfer the dry, drained chicken to the sauce, stirring to coat each piece evenly.
- The heating time is related to the time for the chicken to drain. You need to let the chicken cook in the sauce for a few minutes until reheated.

![step16](../Week01/Process/16.jpeg)  

<strong>5. Put toppings </strong>
- Pour the prepared chicken over the rice, and match it with sesame seeds and chopped green onions. 
- General Tso's chicken needs to be eaten while it is hot.
- Serve rice individually in bowls. Sprinkle sesame seeds and scallions liberally over the chicken.
